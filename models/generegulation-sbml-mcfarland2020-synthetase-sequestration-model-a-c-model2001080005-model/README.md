## Description

The Synthetase Sequestration Model (SSM) is a simplified translation model that considers explicitly two main steps in the process of tRNA aminoacylation: first, the tRNA is bound by the aminoacyl tRN


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/generegulation-sbml-mcfarland2020-synthetase-sequestration-model-a-c-model2001080005-model/model.yaml
