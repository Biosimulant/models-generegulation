# Dhawan2019 - Endogenous miRNA sponges mediate the generation of oscillatory dynamics for a non-coding RNA network

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000841)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Andrew Dhawan; Adrian L Harris; Francesca M Buffa; Jacob G Scott

## Description

This is a delay differential equation model showing how non-coding RNA, acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges in a conserved RNA-transcription factor feedback motif, can five rise to oscillatory behaviou


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
